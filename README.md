Time series forecasting Los Angeles studio rentals 

Los Angeles, the land of sunshine and Hollywood, has always been a sought after place to live attracting everyone from starving artists to movie stars. 

However, finding an affordable studio rental is increasingly becoming harder in the City of Angels. For reference, studio rental prices spiked 4.20% in downtown LA between 2016 through 2017 ranking 10th overall among major metropolitan areas in the U.S. In case you are curious, Bellevue (9.67%), Seattle (9.43%), and Indianapolis(6.65%) had the biggest spikes in studio rental prices over this timeframe. Interestingly, downtown LA studio rentals ($2130 per month) were more expensive than downtown San Francisco studio rentals  ($2095 per month) for November 2017 prices.

Understanding and forecasting downtown LA studio rental prices is a good way to assess the overall market trend in LA's outer parts including Venice Beach, Santa Monica, and Malibu. We built a time series model for analyzing and projecting downtown LA studio rental prices for 2018 using data from Zillow (data from  March, 2012 through November, 2017).
